                        Shimazu Toyohisa manages to fatally wound Ai Naomasa during the Battle of Sekigahara, while he himself was seriously wounded. Toyohisa leaves the battlefield wounded and bleeding profusely, after that he finds himself in a long corridor with many doors, in the middle of which there is a table and a strange man in glasses is sitting behind it, who is waiting for him. This man — Murasaki, writing something in his form, sends Toyohisa against his will to the nearest door, after leaving which, he wakes up in another world. There Toyohisa meets other great warriors like him, who are part of a group called "Wanderers". In a new world for himself, Toyohisa meets both ordinary people and a number of fantastic creatures, including elves, dwarves and hobbits. This world is at war, people are waging an unsuccessful war against another group of great warriors — "Brats" who want to seize power over the world and kill all people, along with the Wanderers. There are many terrible creatures under the command of the Spawn, including dragons, which they use to destroy everything in their path. At the beginning of the story, the Spawn Army controls the northern part of the continent, and is currently trying to invade the south through a fortress in the north of the country called Karnead. Meanwhile, the organization "Octobrists" — a group of people-magicians, for whom this world is native, are trying to find and bring together as many different Wanderers as possible in order to save their world from cruel Offspring.
