                        The action takes place in a world where most people are born with an unusual ability, which is called a "quirk" (yap. Kosei, dosl. "individuality, individual character; characteristic features") [8]. However, the main character, Izuku Midoriya, was born without a quirk. Dreaming of someday becoming a hero (yap. Hi:ro:), he is stubbornly trying to achieve unprecedented strength and get closer to his dream. After meeting with his idol Almighty, he gets his own superpowers and decides to enroll in the academy "Yuey" (UA) (yap. Yu: hey Ko:ko:). Despite the almost failed entrance test, Shizuku still enters the desired educational institution.
