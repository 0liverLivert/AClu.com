                        The action revolves around Ronin during the Sengoku period, who was born with ugly physical abnormalities not comparable to Yu's life, due to the fact that the day before his father, the daimyo, made a deal with 48 demons who gave him great power and prosperity, but in exchange they took one organ from the child. The father, intoxicated with his happiness, demands to kill the "freak" without a drop of sympathy, and the mother lets the child go down the river, but he is still found by the healer and magician Homma, who, with the help of healing magic and alchemy, inserts organs to the child, extracted from other children who died during the war. Since the new "prostheses" retained the power of healing magic, the boy became practically invulnerable to any fatal wounds and blows. M alchik also received an unusual sword capable of killing demons and other spirits. However, the presence of prosthetics does not make the boy free from the curse of 48 demons. A grown-up and already young warrior, named Hyakkimaru, learns that if he kills all 48 demons, he will be able to inject himself with all the lost organs. During his travels, Hyakkimaru meets a little orphan thief named Dororo, who, pretending to be a boy, decides to accompany him on a careful journey.
