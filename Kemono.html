To investigate these incidents, a private detective named Kohachi Inugami arrives in the village, specializing in cases related to the occult. On the way, he meets a strange boy who, instead of going to school like all ordinary children, works in the field every day. The boy's name is Kabane Kusaka, but in the village they dislike him and call him by the nickname "Dorotabo" — in honor of the Youkai living in the mud of the rice field. While Inugami is investigating, he becomes convinced of his supernatural nature, and also manages to make friends with Dorotabo, who may not only have an inhuman name…
