                        Ten years before the main events, a great misfortune occurs: the capital of the kingdom of Lyonesse is attacked, killing almost all the Holy Knights, and seven of the strongest knights are declared guilty — seven Deadly Sins. Rumors are beginning to circulate among people about their extreme atrocities and cruelty. Currently, a palace coup is taking place in the kingdom, because of which the Holy Knights seize power and imprison the royal family. A young princess named Elizabeth manages to escape, and she goes on a long journey in search of Mortal Sins, seeing in them the last hope to save the royal family and the whole of Lyonesse. Trying to get rid of her pursuers, the girl wanders into the tavern of a young man, who in fact turns out to be the former leader of Mortal Sins — Meliodas, who owns the strongest of the seven sins, the dragon sin of anger. He listens to the girl's request and agrees to help her find the rest of her Sins.
