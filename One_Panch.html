                        Monsters are raging on an unnamed planet, and the Hero Association was created to fight them. In it, each of its members is ranked from class "C" to class "S". The hero's class depends on his reputation and abilities. The main character is Saitama, who performs heroic deeds for his own entertainment. Since childhood, he dreamed of becoming a superhero. After growing up and fighting the monster for the first time, he began his training, which, according to him, brought him to the point that now he can defeat any opponent with one blow. Despite his exploits, Saitama did not advertise them and remained unknown to society for a long time. Having found a young cyborg Genos as a student, Saitama learns from him about the Association of Heroes and enters it, passing all physical tests with records, but failing the written part, which is why he gets into the C-class, and Genos into the S-class. So it turns out that most of the heroes who get to know Saitama look down on him, not believing that he is actually stronger than any Hero of the Association, but those who get to know him better begin to respect him and ask to be his students. Gradually, Saitama's name gains some fame, but society still refuses to recognize his merits and even criticizes the hero for the city buildings destroyed during the battles. Despite this, Saitama continued his participation in the Heroes Association and was later enrolled in the B-class. After the alien attack, whose ship was destroyed by Saitama, the Heroes Association received additional funding and expanded its own influence. The monsters, dissatisfied with the strengthening of the Association of Heroes, created their own Association of Monsters (Eng. Monster Association), which started an organized fight against heroes.
